This depends on the unmerged https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/pull/10282

A Lua REPL in the console with Tab completion and pretty-printing of returned tables. It lets you test mpv's and Lua's API without writing a script.

It is bound to `Ctrl+r` by default, and you can bind a different key to `script-binding lua-repl`.

`return` is automatically inserted before statements when doing so does not break them.
